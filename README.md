# About Me

## Before GA:
I was an Escrow Officer/Supervisor at a title/escrow company in Alaska.

## Outcomes support I need:
Mostly I am looking for the job postings, or direction on what companies I should go for.

## Day 1 Goals:
Understand JS loops better, it was a head-scratcher for me during the pre-work.

## Two Truths and a Lie

1. I lived with a roommate I didn't want for 5 years so that I could travel more.
2. My favorite sandwich is the French Dip covered in au ju.
3. I hate owning a car.

## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I am drawn to working for a startup, I feel like I may learn more working in that environment. That's really my goal for my first job -to be able to grow. I would love a mentor.

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
I am leaning towards Frontend but I honestly don't know. I am super great working with other people (even dealing with clients) so whichever role takes me in that direction I'd probably excel at.
